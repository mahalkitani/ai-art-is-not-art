      <h1>The Problem with AI in Art</h1>

    <br>

    <h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
    <p>
      You may not realize it, but art is in everything. Just like how math and science find their way into even the most obscure, niche places, art has its place as well.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      Think of your favorite pastime. Is it watching sports? Playing video games? Cooking? Whatever it is, art is guaranteed to play a part.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Illustrators create the logo of your favorite sports team.</li>
        <li>Concept artists come up with the designs of your favorite characters.</li>
        <li>Chefs and food artists make the food you eat look delectable.</li>
      </ul>
<br>
    <h3>"But, AI does it better!"</h3>
    <p>
      From an untrained eye, it can certainly seem like AI makes art and other artistic creations better than even the best humans. However, there are multiple factors crucial to art which AI completely ignores. A human with experience, on the other hand, would make every move with intention, rather than copying the strokes of art that has already been posted on the internet.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      The point of art is not to create an impressive product of beautifully placed strokes of color. The point of art is to create. If you want a delicious, homecooked meal, you aren't going to find it in the frozen section of a supermarket (unless, of course, your standards are incredibly low). You'd find it by gathering the ingredients you need, maybe reading a recipe or two, and cooking the food yourself.
    </p>
<br>
  <h3>What harm has AI done?</h3>

    <p>
      You've likely heard the many cries of artists and non-artists alike around the world about what AI has done to the artistic community. Because generative AI has seen a steep rise in usage over the past few years, it has also consequently caused a steep decline in artists' income (which, might I add, was already low to begin with). This artificial intelligence explosion has also created what I like to call a "banality epidemic". Those who catch the AI "disease" stop thinking creatively because they have the AI model to do the creative things for them.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Then comes the legal issues. What does AI really get up to when you prompt it? Whether you're asking it for generated text or generated images, the process remains the same: It undergoes what is called "data scraping" and churns out the data it finds into an orderly result for you to see. In terms of pictures, it scours the internet for relevant images and combines them as best it can into one image.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>There are multiple things wrong with this. Firstly, it paves the way for legal issues to ensue; not all the images you can find on the internet are available for anyone to use. Sure, you can look at them, but you can't use them for yourself, and definitely not without due credit. That's where the issue of plagiarism comes into play. AI doesn't credit the art it scrapes. It mimics pixels. So, when you ask your AI model for a cute little hand-drawn cat, you're actually stealing and plagiarizing the art of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of artists. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>However!</h3>
    <p>Artists can actually use AI!</p>
    <br>
    <p>"But wait, that contradicts all FIVE paragraphs you've just written!"</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let me explain. As much as I've argued against AI, I cannot deny it has its place in the future of technology. There is simply no way to halt its growth or to eradicate it from any particular field completely. However, that does not mean we should let it be so capable or so easily accessible, with as harmful as it is. AI should be a tool for artists to use in their art journey, not a device to travel the entire journey for them. Think, for example, digital art; when it first became popular, many people argued it was cheating compared to traditional art. However, it didn't make art any easier, what with learning curves and the other hurdles that come with using new programs. It just provided the materials artists may want to use but could not get their hands on (such as expensive brushes, colors, etc.). It became an instrument for artists to hone their skills, and that is exactly what AI should be.
