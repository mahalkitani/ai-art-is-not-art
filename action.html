            <li><b><h3>Support Your Artists!</h3></b>
              Know a starving artist? Or perhaps a well-fed artist whose artistry you'd like to support? If you're able to, make sure to make that difference.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you don't know any, there are plenty of artists out there eagerly waiting to draw for you. Here are some popular websites you can find artists to commission on!

                <li><a href="https://unvale.io/">Unvale</a></li>

            <br>
            <li><b><h3>Advocate for Your Artists!</h3></b>
              Art isn't the most niche field of all, but it is certainly in trouble. Make your voice known and let the world know you love art.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b><h3>Propose Changes for Your Artists!</h3></b>
              Tired of the way things are? Change it! If you live in the U.S., contact your representative and suggest the change you want to see. Because AI is becoming increasingly problematic, chances are your proposal will be discussed!
